### Objectives

- Refactor the App, TodoList, and AddTodo class components to function components using React Hooks.

- Use the useState hook to manage state within the function components.

- Use the useEffect hook if necessary for lifecycle methods replacement.

- Ensure the application functionality remains unchanged after the refactor.
