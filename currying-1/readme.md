##### 

You are given a series of test cases in /index.test.js that your **filterBy** function needs to pass. These tests involve filtering an array of mock data (MOCK_DATA) based on different properties such as name and email.

### Objectives

 Implement the filterBy function in the /index.js file. This function should:

- Accept a property name (e.g., name or email) and return another function.

- The returned function should accept a property value (e.g., "Michael") and return yet another function.

- This final function should accept an array of objects (like MOCK_DATA) and return a filtered array based on the provided property name and value.
