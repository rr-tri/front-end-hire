##### 

Polyfills are a way to add functionality to the JavaScript language by implementing methods that are not natively supported. This is useful for older browsers that do not support newer features of the language. 

In this exercise, you will implement a polyfill for the **String.split()** method. Also, they are interview questions that are commonly asked in JavaScript interviews.

### Objectives

- Implement the functionality of the String.split() method in a standalone function.

- The function should correctly use the separator and handle cases where the separator is not provided.

- It should also respect the optional limit argument.

### Tests

Write tests to cover the following scenarios:

1. The function splits a string correctly using a provided separator.

2. The function returns the original string as a single-element array when no separator is provided.

3. The function correctly applies the limit argument when provided.
