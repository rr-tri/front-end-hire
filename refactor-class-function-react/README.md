# [Refactor: React - Class to Function Components](https://www.frontendhire.com/questions/refactor-class-function-react-1)

    "The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity." - Marijn Haverbeke

### Objectives

    Refactor the App, TodoList, and AddTodo class components to function components using React Hooks.
    Use the useState hook to manage state within the function components.
    Use the useEffect hook if necessary for lifecycle methods replacement.
    Ensure the application functionality remains unchanged after the refactor.
