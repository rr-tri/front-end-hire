# [JS Polyfill: Array.at() Method](https://www.frontendhire.com/questions/polyfill-array-at)

    "Back to the future!" - Array edition.

Polyfills are a way to add functionality to the JavaScript language by implementing methods that are not natively supported. This is useful for older browsers that do not support newer features of the language. In this exercise, you will implement a polyfill for the Array.at() method. Also, they are interview questions that are commonly asked in JavaScript interviews.
### Objectives

    Implement a polyfill for the Array.at() method.
    The method should work for both positive and negative integers.
    It should return undefined for out-of-bound indices.

### Tests

Write tests to cover the following scenarios:

    The method returns the correct item for a positive index.
    The method returns the correct item for a negative index.
    The method returns undefined for an index that is out of the array's bounds.
