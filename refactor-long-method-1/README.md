### Objectives

- Identify areas in the 'processSalesData' function that can be refactored.

- Write tests to confirm the current behaviour of the function.

- Apply the 'Extract Method' technique to break down the function into smaller, more manageable parts.

- Ensure that the refactored code passes all the provided tests.

### Tests

Consider writing tests for the following scenarios:

1. The function correctly calculates the total sales for valid sales records.

2. The function ignores sales records with negative amounts.

3. The function handles an empty array without errors.
