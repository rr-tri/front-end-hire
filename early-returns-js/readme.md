# [Refactoring](https://www.frontendhire.com/questions/early-returns-js): Early Returns

    Why was the function always calm? Because it believed in early returns!

### Objectives

Your task is to refactor the processOrder function to use early returns, enhancing its readability and maintainability. Early returns involve exiting a function as soon as a certain condition is met, rather than nesting multiple if/else statements. This will involve:

    Identifying opportunities for early returns in the given code.
    Refactoring the code to implement early returns.
    Ensuring the refactored code maintains its original functionality through tests.

### Tests

Consider writing tests for the following scenarios:

    The order is not paid.
    The order is paid but not shipped.
    The order is shipped.
    The order is cancelled.
