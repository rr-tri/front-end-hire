# [useHistory: Custom Hook with a touch of Data Structures](https://www.frontendhire.com/questions/use-history)

    "Mistakes are always forgivable if one has the courage to admit them." - Bruce Lee

### Objectives

    Implement the useHistory hook, which should manage the history of states.
    Use this hook in a simple Todo application to add, undo, and redo tasks.
    Ensure the hook handles the history of states efficiently.

### Todo App

    The app should allow adding new todos.
    Implement undo and redo functionality using the useHistory hook.
    Clearing history should reset the state to its initial value.
