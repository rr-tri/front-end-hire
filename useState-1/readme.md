# useState - 1

   [Link to Question](https://www.frontendhire.com/questions/use-state-1)

This question revolves around the most frequently used hook in React development.
    
    "Why did the useState hook feel so important? Because every time something changed, it was called upon!"   

## Objective

Your task is to implement the logic for managing tasks â€“ including storing, adding, and deleting them within a local state variable. Focus on functionality, and don't worry about styling, although you're welcome to add some if you wish. TailwindCSS is already set up for your convenience.
Requirements

    -- Storing Tasks: Implement a state variable to hold the list of tasks.
    -- Adding Tasks: Write the logic to add new tasks to the state.
    -- Deleting Tasks: Write the logic to remove tasks based on their id.

Working with Task IDs

In this question, each task will need a unique identifier (ID). For simplicity, you can use Math.random() to generate a pseudo-random ID for new tasks. Here's a quick way to do it:

const newTaskId = Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);

This will create a string that's reasonably unique for our purposes. However, keep in mind that in real-world applications, more robust methods are recommended for generating unique IDs (see resources).
Bonus Task

    Implement a clear all tasks feature.
