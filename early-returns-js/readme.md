# [Refactor: Early Returns | Frontend Hire](https://www.frontendhire.com/questions/early-returns-js)

##### 

> "Why was the function always calm? Because it believed in early returns!" 

##### 

### Objectives

Your task is to refactor the **processOrder** function to use early returns, enhancing its readability and maintainability. 

Early returns involve exiting a function as soon as a certain condition is met, rather than nesting multiple if/else statements. This will involve:

- Identifying opportunities for early returns in the given code.

- Refactoring the code to implement early returns.

- Ensuring the refactored code maintains its original functionality through tests.

### Tests

Consider writing tests for the following scenarios:

1. The order is not paid.

2. The order is paid but not shipped.

3. The order is shipped.

4. The order is cancelled.
