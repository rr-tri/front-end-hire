### Objectives

- Implement the useHistory hook, which should manage the history of states.

- Use this hook in a simple Todo application to add, undo, and redo tasks.

- Ensure the hook handles the history of states efficiently.

### Todo App

1. The app should allow adding new todos.

2. Implement undo and redo functionality using the useHistory hook.

3. Clearing history should reset the state to its initial value.
